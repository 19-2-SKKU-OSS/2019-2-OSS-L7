"""
Given the capacity, source and sink of a graph,
computes the maximum flow from source to sink.

Input : capacity, source, sink
Output : maximum flow from source to sink

Capacity is a two-dimensional array that is v*v.
capacity[i][j] implies the capacity of the edge from i to j.
If there is no edge from i to j, capacity[i][j] should be zero.
